# Noir Films Api
This API is intended to be used for the _Noir Films_ movie club. It uses it's own data, as well as data provided by [The MovieDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started) to keep track of movies the group would like to see, as well as which movies they have already seen.
